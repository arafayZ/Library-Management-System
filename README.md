Library Management System DBMS Project â€“ Full Description
This project is a Library Management System designed for the Database Management Systems (DBMS) course. It demonstrates the practical application of core DBMS concepts, including database design, SQL querying, transactions, and data control. The system efficiently handles essential library operations such as book borrowing, returning, and membership management, ensuring smooth operation for both librarians and members.

Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to build a relational database that:

Manages large volumes of data related to books, members, and borrowing activities.
Ensures data integrity and consistency through constraints and triggers.
Simplifies user interaction with complex data through views and stored procedures.
Provides secure access through role-based permissions using DCL.
Core Features
Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

A well-defined ER model that illustrates the relationships between various entities such as books, members, loans, and staff.
Database Schema

SQL scripts for creating the database schema, including tables with primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints to ensure data integrity.
SQL Queries

Predefined SQL queries for common library operations, such as:
Searching for books by title, author, or genre.
Registering new members.
Borrowing and returning books.
Viewing borrowed and overdue books.
Views

Custom views that provide simplified access to critical data, such as a list of currently borrowed books or overdue returns.
Triggers

SQL triggers to automate actions, such as updating book availability status after a borrow or return operation.
Transactions

Sample SQL transactions to ensure atomicity and consistency, demonstrating the use of COMMIT and ROLLBACK.
Data Control Language (DCL)

Queries to manage user roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
Sample Data

Preloaded data sets for testing and demonstrating the functionality of the system.
How to Run the Project
Clone or download the repository.
Use a DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MS SQL Server) to run the SQL scripts provided.
Load the sample data using the provided insert scripts.
Execute the queries and test the library operations.
Technologies Used
DBMS: MySQL / PostgreSQL / MS SQL Server (any relational database system can be used)
SQL: For creating tables, queries, views, triggers, and transactions
ER Diagram: Designed using database modeling tools
Learning Outcomes
By working on this project, users will gain:

A deep understanding of relational database design.
Practical experience in writing SQL queries, triggers, and transactions.
Insight into managing real-world operations like user roles and permissions.
Hands-on practice in implementing data consistency and integrity.
